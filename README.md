remote start -> spark core -> mifi -> internet <- iphone

### about this project

I started this project to get remote start working on my car from my iPhone. Much like Viper SmartStart or CompuStarâ€™s Drone Mobile.

### disclaimer

This is a project for myself. I am happy to share what I have done but make no guarantee that anyone else attempting this will enjoy the same success, or failures, that I have.

### current features

* Simple API
  * All calls to the Spark Core can be done through a REST call. This gives me the option to make anything that has an internet connection a remote. Ideas include my TiVo and Pebble watch.
* iOS Client
  * Screenshots

* Four buttons are supported on the remote
* Status LED
* Temperature sensor

### feature wish list
* detect when car is running
* detect door lock/unlock state
* gps
* unlock door when phone is within a few feet of the car

### hardware required

* Compustar Remote Start
* Compustar Remote 1WSHR
* Spark Core [spark.io](http://spark.io/)
* FreedomPop Wireless MiFi
* Device running iOS 7+
* Temperature Sensor LM34DZ
* Optocoupler (I used a LTV-847)
* Dual color LED (You can use separate LEDs if you like)

You can substitute these items for anything that is equivalent. Arduino code has some specifics for the Spark Coreâ€™s API but really you just need an Arduino that can have an always on connection to the internet.

### getting started

* Assemble breadboard
  * Use hardware.fzz or png as a reference
  * Solder leads on switches from remote
  * Attach Spark Core to breadboard
  * Pins and switches match up to code in arduno/

* Setup Spark Core
  * Follow instructions on (Connecting your core)[http://docs.spark.io/#/connect]
  * (Create a new App)[https://www.spark.io/build/new] at spark.io
  * Paste the code from arduino/the_user_app.cpp to this new App
  * Obtain your device_id and access_token from spark.io

* iOS
  * Install Cocoapods
    * cd carspark/iOS
    * pod install
  * Open Carspark.xcworkspace
  * Add device_id and access_token to iOS/Carspark/SparkCom.m
  * Build and install device on your iPhone or iPod Touch
